        Russell "Stringer" Bell, played by Idris Elba, serves as drug kingpin Avon Barksdale's second in command. Intelligent and business-savvy, Bell gets As in his economics classes at Baltimore City Community College and even has a copy of Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations on his bookshelf. He also insists that Rules of Order be used at meetings to keep order. He attempts to legitimize the Barksdale drug gang by investing in housing properties and buying influence from politicians.

      <p>
        An intelligent planner and businessman, Bell is a useful advisor to Barksdale and handles the economic decisions for the Barksdale crew. He often tries to temper Avon's bloodthirsty nature. Though not as vengeful as Avon, Stringer is ruthless, being completely devoted to his work, and eliminating threats to the Barksdale organization as soon as they appear.
